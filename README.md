## Project: Yelp business data analysis

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Project proposal 

The proposal is provided in the 'proposal.ipynb'.

### Code

Main code is provided in the `data_project.ipynb`. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory 'Yelp-data' (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook data_project.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook data_project.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

Yelp dataset challenge: https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/

The data is needed to transfer to csv format before running the codes.

### Progress

Finished the data preprocessing and exploratory analysis. Need more work on model development and validation.
